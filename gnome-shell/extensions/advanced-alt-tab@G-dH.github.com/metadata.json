  "description": "Highly customizable replacement for the Alt/Super+Tab window/app switchers that offers 'type to search' mode, various filtering and sorting options, workspace and monitor navigation, configurable hotkeys for navigation and window/app control and an app launcher.\n\nAATWS also has its own optional hot edge triggers that allows you to use it as a mouse controlled 'dock'.  AATWS is also compatible with the Custom Hot Corners - Extended extension, that allows you to configure any mouse button / scroll wheel + monitor corner/edge to open it.\n\nNote that GNOME has 3 built-in window switcher popups and this extension replaces all of them. The first one is grouping windows by applications and is used as default in vanilla GNOME distributions. The second one offers window list and the third one windows of the currently focused application. You can set keyboard shortcuts for all these switchers in the Gnome Settings, look for:\n- Switch applications\n- Switch windows\n- Switch windows of an application\n\nFollow the link below for more information and bug reports.\n\nKeywords: alttab, search, find, window search, popup delay, applications, apps, dock, monitor, window thumbnail, workspace thumbnails preview, move windows, launch application, switch, VIM navigation.",
